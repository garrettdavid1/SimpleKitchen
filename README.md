# SimpleKitchen

This is a simpler rewrite of my Mealeo application. SimpleKitchen is an app that will allow users to create, store, and look up recipes.
Users will be able to search for recipes based off individual ingredients, add them to collections, and generate shopping lists
from collections. Ideally, a user will be able to create a meal schedule and generate a formatted shopping list from it as well.
